Detailed Explanation of Optimizations

1) Redux for Global State Management:

Replaced useState with Redux to manage weather data globally, ensuring consistent state across components and simplifying state updates.

2) React Performance Optimizations:

Memoization: Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components that do not depend on changing props.

Lazy Loading: Implemented React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when needed, reducing initial load time.

3) Paginated API Requests:

Implemented pagination to fetch weather data in chunks, improving performance and user experience by loading data incrementally.

4) Debounced Search Input:

Added a debounce function to delay API calls until the user stops typing, reducing the number of requests and improving performance.

5) Dark Mode Toggle:

Used useContext to manage theme state, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes seamlessly.
